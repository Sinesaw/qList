{"Paulo Coelho": ["Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience","There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure","The secret of life is to fall seven times and to get up eight times","Donâ€™t waste your time with explanations, people only hear what they want to hear","When you repeat a mistake, it is not a mistake anymore: it is a decision"],"Unknown": ["We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them"],"Aristotle":["We are what we repeatedly do; excellence, then, is not an act but a habit"],"Dr. Gregory House": ["If I was kidding, I'd be dressed like you"],"Ambrose Redmoon": ["Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgement that something else is more important than fear"],"Gandhi":["You must be the change you wish to see in the world"],"Abraham Maslow":["To the man who only has a hammer, everything he encounters begins to look like a nail"]}
