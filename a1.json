{"Paulo Coelho": ["Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience","There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure","The secret of life is to fall seven times and to get up eight times","Donâ€™t waste your time with explanations, people only hear what they want to hear","When you repeat a mistake, it is not a mistake anymore: it is a decision"],"Unknown": ["We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them"]}
